# TattooNet Back-end

The TattooNet app is an open-source application designed to help users find tattoo artists in their city and country. It is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express, React native,
and Node.js.

## Project Overview

This project is currently a pet project that showcases my experience with Express and MongoDB. The app allows users to search for tattoo artists based on their location and provides detailed
information about each artist, including their portfolio, ratings, and contact details.

1. Install all project dependencies by running the following command:
